INTRODUCTION                                    *surround-funk*

This was inspired by tpope's |surround| plugin and allows you to delete,
change, yank, and paste the surrounding function and its arguments.

WHAT IS A SURROUNDING FUNCTION?

Below, the * symbols show what would be deleted (or yanked) with the |dsf| (or
|ysf|) command. The ^ symbols show where the cursor can be when issuing the
command:


sf                      Where the name of the function (e.g. outerfunc) is a 
                        standard Vim |word|.

                           **********                *
                        np.outerfunc(arg1, arg2, arg3)
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  
                           **********               *************
                        np.outerfunc(innerfunc(arg1), arg2, arg3)
                           ^^^^^^^^^^               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  
sF                      Where the name of the function (e.g. outerfunc) is 
                        similar to a Vim |WORD|, but in addition to
                        whitespaces, includes commas, semicolons and opening
                        parentheses.

                        *************                *
                        np.outerfunc(arg1, arg2, arg3)
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  
                        *************               *************
                        np.outerfunc(innerfunc(arg1), arg2, arg3)
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

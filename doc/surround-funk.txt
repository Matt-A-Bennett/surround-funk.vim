INTRODUCTION                                    *surround-funk*

This was inspired by tpope's |surround| plugin and allows you to delete,
change and yank a surrounding function along with its additional arguments.
With the surrounding function in the unnamed register, you can 'grip' a word or
another function with it. 'Gripping' will wrap/encompass a word or function
with the one you have in the unnamed register (see below).

USAGE

WHAT IS A SURROUNDING FUNCTION?

Below, the * symbols show what would be deleted (or yanked) with the |dsf| (or
|ysf|) command. The ^ symbols show where the cursor can be when issuing the
command:


sf                      Where the name of the function (e.g. outerfunc) is a 
                        standard Vim |word|.

                           **********               *
                        np.outerfunc(innerfunc(arg1))
                           ^^^^^^^^^^               ^
  
                           **********               *************
                        np.outerfunc(innerfunc(arg1), arg2, arg3)
                           ^^^^^^^^^^               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  
                           **********    *
                        np.outerfunc(arg1)
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  
                           **********                *
                        np.outerfunc(arg1, arg2, arg3)
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  
sF                      Where the name of the function (e.g. np.outerfunc) is 
                        similar to a Vim |WORD|, but is additionally delimited
                        by commas, semicolons and opening parentheses.

                        *************               *
                        np.outerfunc(innerfunc(arg1))
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^               ^

                        *************               *************
                        np.outerfunc(innerfunc(arg1), arg2, arg3)
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        *************    *
                        np.outerfunc(arg1)
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  
                        *************                *
                        np.outerfunc(arg1, arg2, arg3)
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
